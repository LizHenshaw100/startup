# Daily Planner

[My Notes](notes.md)

My start up is a daily planner that let's you cross things off your to-do list easily and share it with friends.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to organize your day and feel great satisfaction in accomplishing tasks? Well look no further than my new website! It's designed to give the user maximum reward when completing things off their to-do list and to prioritize tasks. With more color options than google calendar and better celebrations than google keep, this new website will be your right hand man in no time!

### Design

    Friend->>Website: Request page
    Website-->>Friend: Display content
```

### Key features

- Organized to-do lists
- Share with friends
- Celebrate productivity!

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - HTML page for log in and for the actual calendar. Calendar will look different if it's the user's personal calendar or if they are viewing a friend's.
- **CSS** - Layout will be clean and users will have many color options for their various tasks.
- **React** - Will use for logging in and showing what other users have changed.
- **Service** - Will use for logging in and updating changes.
- **DB/Login** - Will store data for users and allow for registration and signing in.
- **WebSocket** - When someone makes changes or comments, it will be shown to others
